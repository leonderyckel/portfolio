            My name is LÃ©on de Ryckel, a computer science student at EPHEC. I want to work in the development of secure and high-performance digital solutions. My professional project is clear: to establish myself in Cape Town, South Africa, to create my own company or work as a freelancer, designing web applications and custom IT services, with a focus on data security and user satisfaction. Here is my journey, my ambitions, and the strategy I am implementing to achieve these goals.

            <p className="text-lg">
              I think my journey at EPHEC has allowed me to build a solid foundation in almost all areas of computer science. I believe I have acquired varied skills: web development (front-end and back-end), networks, servers, cloud computing, and hardware. This knowledge gives me a global view of IT systems, essential for my future projects.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Currently, I am doing an internship at Bitrix IT, an IT company in Cape Town, where I put my skills to the test in a professional B2B context. In the field, I accompany Mr. Philip Theunissen for troubleshooting at clients: resolving database problems for a clinic, installing Cisco routers and smart switches, repairing defective screens or hard drives, updating operating systems, configuring network printers, and resolving DNS or DHCP issues. These varied and often urgent missions have taught me to combine technical rigor with client communication.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              In parallel, I am developing a web application for my final project (TFE), which also serves Bitrix IT. This ticket management tool includes an automated calendar, a billing module, secure password storage, remote access, and interactive network diagrams to optimize client intervention management. This project allows me to combine my technical skills with strategic thinking about a company's needs, while leaving a concrete contribution to the team.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              My ambition is to become an expert full-stack developer, capable of creating complete web applications, from user interface to back-end infrastructure. In the medium term, I want to work as a freelancer in Cape Town, collaborating with local companies like Bitrix IT. In the long term, I aim to launch my own startup, specialized in secure and innovative digital solutions, in a market where demand for reliable tools is strong.
